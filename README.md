# Vehicle_Turn_Signal
• Created an advanced Turn Signal Control System for vehicles, incorporating four distinct states: Idle state, Left Turn state, Right Turn and Wait Turn state.
• Designed the system using a state machine approach to ensure efficient low-level functionality.
• Implemented the project using three switches with Interrupts: Left Turn button, Right Turn button, and a Wait button, providing intuitive control for the driver.
